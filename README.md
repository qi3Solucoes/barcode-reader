# Angular Barcode Scanner and Validator Application Via Upload, Instant Search and Media Stream (webcam)

This application tend to bring a simple barcode scanner into your browser using your webcam. 
It's just an experimental and definitely can be a lot better. I will try to make this application widely usable as 
soon as possible and possibly make that as an NG Module and reusable soon. 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Further help

To get more help on the `angular-cli` use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
