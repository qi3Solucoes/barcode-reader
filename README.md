# Angular Barcode Scanner and Validator Application Via Upload, Instant Search and Media Stream (webcam)

This application tend to bring a simple barcode scanner into your browser using your webcam. 
It's just an experimental and definitely can be a lot better. I will try to make this application widely usable as 
soon as possible and possibly make that as an NG Module and reusable soon.
